# kinectAirTouchOSC

The name says it all : you can define an horizontal distance to and control the angle of the camera, 
a vertical interaction plane doing blobs analysis and sending the controids coords via OSC will 
always be placed in accordance. On this plane you must draw a rectangle : the coords will be scaled and 
clipped to [-1,1] in this rectangle
